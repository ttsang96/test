### 1.1 Overview

**[SEER v1.0](https://oracle-stag.vebank.io/home)** is our first implementation of centralized, off-chain oracle infrastructure for applications built on VeChain. SEER provides real-time data feeds of 10+ key asset prices: BTC, ETH, VET, VTHO, VeUSD, and more, ensuring every dApps on VeChain networks can easily access reliable and trustworthy datasource.

Strategic values:

- Quick and easy to deploy.
- Easily accessible for dApp builders on VeChain.
- Price stabilization algorithm to protect from extreme price movements.

Our key emphasis is on stability and protection for users against extreme price movements and potential security risk. The use of reputable centralized exchanges ensure good pricing data input, and security risks are mitigated with price stabilization algorithms.

### 1.2 Project Details

#### _1.2.1 Introduction_

SEER v1.0 will have the following UI:

#### 1.2.2 Calculate node logic

1. After getting data from Resource Pool, we will get a list of data about Multi-source Prices like this:

| **ID** | **Price** |
| --- | --- |
| DS1 | Value 1 |
| DS2 | Value 2 |
| DS3 | Value 3 |
| … | … |
| DSn | Value n |

Datasource will come from from exchanges:

| **ID** | **Datasource** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Binance |
| 2 | CoinBase |
| 3 | Kraken |
| 4 | Gemini |
| 5 | Poloniex |
| 6 | Kraken Crypto Watch |
| 7 | Vexchange |

2. Calculating Node will implement a function for choosing &quot;price&quot; at that moment: median, median\_low, median\_high,... This function is controlled by a Redis hash key stored in Redis Cluster. Now we got choosing\_price

    Ex: From 7 data sources, we get 7 prices of pair BTC-USD as below:

        [31021, 31018, 31001, 31009]

3. Algorithm: Using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to calculate the price through time flow. Initial values:

    - Interval Period: SLIDING\_WINDOW\_INTERVAL = 5 (means each 5 seconds algorithm will be implemented one time)
    - Freshness Period: FRESHNESS\_PERIOD = 3600 (means each 1 hour, historic data used for the algorithm will be reset)
    - Flow chart:

### 1.3 Ecosystem Fit

**VeThorChain (VeChain)** is a robust layer-1 blockchain with Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism and is elected to the top 40 most popular global blockchain. The market capitalization of VeChain is recorded at over $2 billion dollars (at the time this application was first written), notably known for its duo-token system, VET and VTHO. With a mission to solve real-world problems on the blockchain, VeChain recently became the _UFC&#39;s first-ever Official Layer 1 Blockchain Partner_, actively promoting the development of DeFi infrastructure and adoption of its recent initiatives VeChain stablecoins (VeUSD) and Alchemy Pay. As total value locked (TVL) up to 10 million dollars is deemed to be an early stage of an ecosystem, VeChain became a fertile ground for developers to build large-scale DeFi projects. However, our study shows that DeFi protocols on VeChain are missing constant, seamless real-time external data feeds, which will eventually limit the ability to add more complex financial layers to the platforms, especially during the time crypto market faces high level of volatility.

In the future, our goal is to further enrich the ecosystem with more essential DeFi products, becoming the primary access point for data into the VeChain ecosystem. Further developments will involve:

(i) Decentralization: upgrade to a decentralized oracle.

(ii) More assets price data feed: support more assets for dApps on VeChain - we will be actively communicating with VeChain users to identify best fits to develop.

(iii) Expand to real-world data: one of our key goals is to get real-world use cases for blockchain dApps (ie. stock market, sport events, weather,... ).
